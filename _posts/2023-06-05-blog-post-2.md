Project TILTTING opened its doors to meteorology students at Millersville University in early April 2023, with the goal of revamping the team in advance of the upcoming chase season. The project committee set out to find new members that are not only passionate about severe weather, but are driven and committed to advance our knowledge on tornadoes and contribute to the field of meteorology. 

An application was opened to students, to which several students applied. The candidates then went through two interview sections for the team to get to know them, as well as the extent of their meteorology and storm chasing knowledge. Several candidates were then accepted into the program as team members and have since been working with the project in preparation of the approaching storm season.
