excerpt: "EPAWA's support comes with a virtual storm chasing experience! The newest addition to the EPAWA lineup is a live stream platform on YouTube that 'nowcasts' storms. This is a major addition for both EPAWA and the research project, as it allows people to get a virtual sense of storm chasing while understanding what is happening on the radar as well. Chief Meteorologist Bobby Martrich will be explaining model guidance, radar data, and different camera angles provided by the research team to fully comprehend both severe weather and the project itself."
