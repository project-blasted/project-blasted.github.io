excerpt: "Windsond is the flagship product of the privately held company Sparv Embedded. Compared to the classic radiosondes, Windsonds do not require the assembly of stationary equipment which allows for mobility in the field. The project's data collection is centered around the Windsond, giving researchers the ability to remain safe by avoiding the tornado's path. Our first Corporate Patron, Sparv Embedded, has given those involved in TILTTING the opportunity to make new discoveries by providing their instrumentation to use for data collection."
