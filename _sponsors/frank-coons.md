Frank Coons studied meteorology (before it was a formal program) and wrestled when Millersville University was a State Teachers College. Upon graduation, Frank went to UCLA for the U.S. Air Force program to educate individuals to serve as Detachment Weather Officers who would forecast for USAF bases and brief pilots heading to overseas missions. After several years, Frank became an Aerial Reconnaissance Weather Observer, flying over 4000 hours in a WB-50 sampling atmospheric conditions. After the WB-50 was retired, Frank provided weather support for refueling tanker operations. After a year of graduate studies at Penn State, Frank joins the Air Weather Service Headquarters where he worked on fog dispersal. He left the USAF in 1972 and joined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Systems Research and Development Service where he worked on warm fog dispersal techniques, low-level wind shear detection. “Those were exciting times and I am proud to say I was part of them,” says Frank. Now approaching 90, he is still trying to support further improvements as demonstrated by his generous donation.

Frank’s gift will go toward funding our instrumentation, equipment, travel and lodging expenses when students are deployed to research IOPs in the Great Plains and the Northeast regions. Thank you Mr. Coons!
