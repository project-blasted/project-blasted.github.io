**Biography**  
Michael McCarthy is from Palmyra PA and enrolled at Millersville in 2023. Ever since he was young, he has had an interest in the weather and always wanted to storm chase. At Millersville, he sought to accomplish this by joining BLASTED in the fall of 2024. He is eager to continue learning about meteorology and the science behind research and hopes to join other research projects. He ultimately hopes to pursue higher education after school, with an interest in severe weather. Outside of school, Michaels loves to play sports, watch football, and hang out with his friends.
