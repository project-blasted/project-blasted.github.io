**Biography**  
Devan Reynolds is a sophmore meteorology major at Millersville University. Growing up in the Midwest outside of Chicago, she was exposed to many kinds of weather from a young age. She has always had a passion for severe weather but after watching researchers such as Reed Timmer, she decided to make her passion into a career path. Devan is aiming to turn her degree into a position as an airline meteorologist, but she remains open to any opportunities. Overall, Devan is excited to help BLASTED grow its research, learning everything she can about severe weather on the way.
