**Biography**  
Alex is from York, Pennsylvania and has always been interested in the weather. At Millersville, he quickly became involved in forecasting and research opportunities on campus. He looks forward to learning more about tornadic supercells as a part of the project. Alex enjoys staying active by either working out, going for a run, or playing soccer. He loves listening to music and hanging out with his friends. Alex is a very eager learner who plans to add his hard work to the BLASTED Team.
